## Find Your IP Address in Windows Settings

Your Windows 10 PC's IP address is your computer's identity on the network to which it's connected. There are times when you may need your IP address to use specific programs. Luckily, the process of finding your IP address on a Windows 10 PC is straightforward.


1. Select Start and type Settings. Select the Settings app.

2. In the Settings window, select Network & Internet.

3. If you're connected to the network via ethernet, select Ethernet from the left menu. Then select the Ethernet Connected icon.

4. Scroll down the page to the Properties section and look for the IPv4 address. This is your computer's IP address on the network it's connected to.

5. If you're using Wi-Fi, then select Wi-Fi from the left menu on the Settings window. Select the Wi-Fi Connected icon at the top of the window.

6. On the Wi-Fi Settings window, scroll down to the Properties section and find the IPv4 address on this page.



## Find Your IP Address Using the Command Prompt


You can also check the IP address your Windows 10 computer uses to connect to the current network using a simple ipconfig command using the command prompt tool.


1. Select Start and type "command prompt", right-click the Command Prompt app, and select Run as administrator.

2. Type "ipconfig" and press Enter. Scroll down to the Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapter you're connected to the network with and look for IPv4 Address. This will display your Windows 10 computer's IP address.



## Find Your External Internet IP Address


The methods above will show you your computer's "local" IP address, meaning the IP address assigned to your computer by your router on your local home network. However, this isn't the IP address you're using when you're on the internet.


1. Connect to your home router as Administrator, and once logged in, look for the section that provides Cable Information and Internet Port information. Here, you should see IP Address/Mask, which displays your internet IP address.

2. Another option is to use one of several websites that can report back to you what your IP address is. Two of the most popular of these are WhatIsMyIP.com and MyIP.com.

3. Either of these options will give you your internet IP address.
